        "This Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement is between the entity you represent, or, if you do not designate an entity in connection with a Subscription purchase or renewal, you individually (\"you\" or \"your\"), and Microsoft Corporation (\"Microsoft\", \"we\", \"us\", or \"our\"). It consists of the terms and conditions below, as well as the Online Services Terms, the SLAs, and the Offer Details for your Subscription or renewal (together, the \"agreement\"). It is effective on the date we provide you with confirmation of your Subscription or the date on which your Subscription is renewed, as applicable. Key terms are defined in Section 8.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Use of Online Services\n",
        "\n",
        "a. Right to use. We grant you the right to access and use the Online Services and to install and use the Software included with your Subscription, as further described in this agreement. We reserve all other rights.\n",
        "\n",
        "b. Acceptable use. You may use the Product only in accordance with this agreement. You may not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or work around technical limitations in the Product, except to the extent applicable law permits it despite these limitations. You may not disable, tamper with, or otherwise attempt to circumvent any billing mechanism that meters your use of the Online Services. You may not rent, lease, lend, resell, transfer, or host the Product, or any portion thereof, to or for third parties except as expressly permitted in this agreement or the Online Services Terms.\n",
        "\n",
        "c. End Users. You control access by End Users, and you are responsible for their use of the Product in accordance with this agreement. For example, you will ensure End Users comply with the Acceptable Use Policy.\n",
        "\n",
        "d. Customer Data. You are solely responsible for the content of all Customer Data. You will secure and maintain all rights in Customer Data necessary for us to provide the Online Services to you without violating the rights of any third party or otherwise obligating Microsoft to you or to any third party. Microsoft does not and will not assume any obligations with respect to Customer Data or to your use of the Product other than as expressly set forth in this agreement or as required by applicable law.\n",
        "\n",
        "e. Responsibility for your accounts. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any non-public authentication credentials associated with your use of the Online Services. You must promptly notify our customer support team about any possible misuse of your accounts or authentication credentials or any security incident related to the Online Services.\n",
        "\n",
        "f. Preview releases. We may make Previews available. Previews are provided \"as-is\", \"with all faults\", and \"as-available\", and are excluded from the SLAs and all limited warranties provided in this agreement. Previews may not be covered by customer support. We may change or discontinue Previews at any time without notice. We also may choose not to release a Preview into general availability.\n",
        "\n",
        "g. Managed Services for Microsoft Azure. You may use Microsoft Azure Services to provide a Managed Service Solution provided (1) you have the sole ability to access, configure, and administer the Microsoft Azure Services, (2) you have administrative access to the virtual OSE(s), if any, in the Managed Service Solution, and (3) the third party has administrative access only to its application(s) or virtual OSE(s). You are responsible for the third party's use of Microsoft Azure Services in accordance with the terms of this agreement. Your provision of Managed Services remains subject to the following limitations (and any other limitations in the Online Services Terms):\n",
        "\n",
        "(i) You may not resell or redistribute the Microsoft Azure Services.\n",
        "\n",
        "(ii) You may not allow multiple users to directly or indirectly access any Microsoft Azure Services feature that is made available on a per-user basis.\n",
        "\n",
        "h. Administrator Assumption of Control. If you use an email address provided by an organization you are affiliated with (e.g. an employer or school) to order an Online Service individually, you represent that you have authority to use that organization's domain to sign up for a Subscription in your capacity as a member of that organization. The organization, as the owner of the domain associated with your email address, may assume control over and manage your use of the Online Services. In such a case, your organization's designated administrator (your \"admin\") may (i) control and administer your account, including modifying and terminating your access and (ii) access and process your data, including the contents of your communications and files. Microsoft may inform you that your organization has assumed control of the Online Services covered by your Subscription, but Microsoft is under no obligation to provide such notice. If your organization is administering your use of the Online Services or managing the tenant associated with your Subscription, direct your data subject requests and privacy inquiries to your administrator. If your organization is not administering your use of the Online Service or managing such tenant, direct your data subject requests and privacy inquiries to Microsoft.\n",
        "\n",
        "i. Shared Directory Data. When you order an Online Service using an email address with a domain provided by an organization you are affiliated with (e.g. an employer or school), the Online Service adds you to a directory of users that share the same email domain. Your directory data (name, date of signup, and email address) may be visible to other users of Online Services within your organization's email domain.\n",
        "\n",
        "j. Additional Software for use with the Online Services. To enable optimal access to and use of certain Online Services, you may install and use certain Software in connection with your use of the Online Service as described in the Online Services Terms. We license Software to you; we do not sell it. Proof of your Software license is (1) this agreement, (2) any order confirmation, and (3) proof of payment. Your rights to access Software on any device do not give you any right to implement Microsoft patents or other Microsoft intellectual property in software or devices that access that device.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Purchasing services\n",
        "\n",
        "a. Available Subscription offers. The Portal provides Offer Details for available Subscription offers, which generally can be categorized as one or a combination of the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "(i) Commitment Offering. You commit in advance to purchase a specific quantity of Online Services for use during a Term and to pay upfront or on a periodic basis in advance of use. With respect to Microsoft Azure Services, additional or other usage (for example, usage beyond your commitment quantity) may be treated as a Consumption Offering. Committed quantities not used during the Term will expire at the end of the Term.\n",
        "\n",
        "(ii) Consumption Offering (also called Pay-As-You-Go). You pay based on actual usage in the preceding month with no upfront commitment. Payment is on a periodic basis in arrears.\n",
        "\n",
        "(iii) Limited Offering. You receive a limited quantity of Online Services for a limited term without charge (for example, as a trial Subscription or free account) or as part of another Microsoft offering (for example, MSDN). Provisions in this agreement with respect to pricing, cancellation fees, payment, and data retention may not apply.\n",
        "\n",
        "b. Ordering.\n",
        "\n",
        "(i) By ordering or renewing a Subscription, you agree to the Offer Details for that Subscription. Unless otherwise specified in those Offer Details, Online Services are offered on an \"as available\" basis. You may place orders for your Affiliates under this agreement and grant your Affiliates administrative rights to manage the Subscription, but Affiliates may not place orders under this agreement. You also may assign the rights granted under Section 1.a. to a third party for use by that third party in your internal business. If you grant any rights to Affiliates or third parties with respect to Software or your Subscription, such Affiliates or third parties will be bound by this agreement and you agree to be jointly and severally liable for any actions of such Affiliates or third parties related to their use of the Products.\n",
        "\n",
        "(ii) Some offers may permit you to modify the quantity of Online Services ordered during the Term of a Subscription. Additional quantities of Online Services added to a Subscription will expire at the end of that Subscription. If you decrease the quantity during a Term, we may charge you a cancellation fee for the decrease in quantity as described below in Section 3.b..\n",
        "\n",
        "c. Pricing and payment. Payments are due and must be made according to the Offer Details for your Subscription.\n",
        "\n",
        "(i) For Commitment Offerings, the price level may be based on the quantity of Online Services you ordered. Some offers may permit you to modify the quantity of Online Services ordered during the Term and your price level may be adjusted accordingly, but price level changes will not be retroactive. During the Term of your Subscription, prices for Online Services will not be increased, as to your Subscription, from those posted in the Portal at the time your Subscription became effective or was renewed, except where prices are identified as temporary in the Offer Details, or for Previews or Non-Microsoft Products. All prices are subject to change at the beginning of any Subscription renewal.\n",
        "\n",
        "(ii) For Consumption Offerings, pricing is subject to change at any time upon notice.\n",
        "\n",
        "d. Renewal.\n",
        "\n",
        "(i) Upon renewal of your Subscription, this agreement will terminate, and your Subscription will thereafter be governed, by the terms and conditions set forth in the Portal on the date on which your Subscription is renewed (the \"Renewal Terms\"). If you do not agree to any Renewal Terms, you may decline to renew your Subscription.\n",
        "\n",
        "(ii) For Commitment Offerings, you may choose to have a Subscription automatically renew or terminate upon expiration of the Term. Automatic renewal is pre-selected. You can change your selection at any time during the Term. If the existing Term is longer than one calendar month, we will provide you with notice of the automatic renewal before the expiration of the Term.\n",
        "\n",
        "(iii) For Consumption Offerings, your Subscription will renew automatically for additional one-month terms until you terminate the Subscription.\n",
        "\n",
        "(iv) For Limited Offerings, renewal may not be permitted.\n",
        "\n",
        "e. Eligibility for Academic, Government and Nonprofit versions. You agree that if you are purchasing an academic, government or nonprofit offer, you meet the respective eligibility requirements listed at the following sites:\n",
        "\n",
        "(i) For academic offers, the requirements for educational institutions (including administrative offices or boards of education, public libraries, or public museums) listed in the Microsoft Licensing Resources and Documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "(ii) For government offers, the requirements listed in the Microsoft Licensing Resources and Documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "(iii) For nonprofit offers, the requirements listed in the Microsoft Licensing Resources and Documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "Microsoft reserves the right to verify eligibility at any time and suspend the Online Service if the eligibility requirements are not met.\n",
        "\n",
        "f. Taxes. Prices are exclusive of any taxes unless otherwise specified on the invoice as tax inclusive. You must pay any applicable value added, goods and services, sales, gross receipts, or other transaction taxes, fees, charges or surcharges, or any regulatory cost recovery surcharges or similar amounts that are owed under this agreement and which we are permitted to collect from you under applicable law. You will be responsible for any applicable stamp taxes and for all other taxes that you are legally obligated to pay including any taxes that arise on the distribution or provision of Products to your Affiliates. We will be responsible for all taxes based on our net income, gross receipts taxes imposed in lieu of taxes on income or profits, or taxes on our property ownership.\n",
        "\n",
        "If any taxes are required to be withheld on payments you make to us, you may deduct such taxes from the amount owed to us and pay them to the appropriate taxing authority; provided, however, that you promptly secure and deliver an official receipt for those withholdings and other documents we reasonably request to claim a foreign tax credit or refund. You must ensure that any taxes withheld are minimized to the extent possible under applicable law.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Term, termination, and suspension\n",
        "\n",
        "a. Agreement term and termination. This agreement will remain in effect until the expiration, termination, or renewal of your Subscription, whichever is earliest.\n",
        "\n",
        "b. Subscription termination. You may terminate a Subscription at any time during its Term; however, you must pay all amounts due and owing before the termination is effective.\n",
        "\n",
        "(i) One-Month Subscription. A Subscription having a one-month Term may be terminated anytime without any cancellation fee.\n",
        "\n",
        "(ii) Subscriptions of more than one-month. If you terminate a Subscription to Microsoft Azure Services within 30 days of the date on which the Subscription became effective or was renewed, no refunds will be provided, and you must pay for the initial 30 days of the Subscription, but no payments will be due for the remaining portion of the terminated Subscription. If you terminate a Subscription to Microsoft Azure Services at any other time during the term, you must pay for the remainder of the Term, and no refunds will be provided.\n",
        "\n",
        "(iii) Limited Offerings. Microsoft may terminate your Subscription to a Limited Offering at any time during the Term immediately without notice.\n",
        "\n",
        "(iv) Other Subscriptions. For all other Subscriptions, if you terminate a Subscription before the end of the Term, you must pay a fee equal to one-month's Subscription fee and you will receive a refund of any portion of the Subscription fee you have paid for the remainder of the Term; provided, however, no refunds will be provided for partially unused months.\n",
        "\n",
        "c. Suspension. We may suspend your use of the Online Services if: (1) it is reasonably needed to prevent unauthorized access to Customer Data; (2) you fail to respond to a claim of alleged infringement under Section 5 within a reasonable time; (3) you do not pay amounts due under this agreement; (4) you do not abide by the Acceptable Use Policy or you violate other terms of this agreement; or (5) for Limited Offerings, the Subscription becomes inactive from your failure to access the Online Services as described in the Offer Details. If one or more of these conditions occurs, then:\n",
        "\n",
        "(i) For Limited Offerings, we may suspend your use of the Online Services, your Subscription and your account immediately without notice.\n",
        "\n",
        "(ii) For all other Subscriptions, a suspension will apply to the minimum necessary part of the Online Services and will be in effect only while the condition or need exists. We will give notice before we suspend, except where we reasonably believe we need to suspend immediately. We will give at least 30 days' notice before suspending for non-payment. If you do not fully address the reasons for the suspension within 60 days after we suspend, we may terminate your Subscription and delete your Customer Data without any retention period. We may also terminate your Subscription if your use of the Online Services is suspended more than twice in any 12-month period.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Warranties\n",
        "\n",
        "a. Limited warranty.\n",
        "\n",
        "(i) Online Services. We warrant that the Online Services will meet the terms of the SLA during the Term. Your only remedies for breach of this warranty are those in the SLA.\n",
        "\n",
        "(ii) Software. We warrant for one year from the date you first use the Software that it will perform substantially as described in the applicable user documentation. If Software fails to meet this warranty we will, at our option and as your exclusive remedy, either (1) return the price paid for the Software or (2) repair or replace the Software.\n",
        "\n",
        "b. Limited warranty exclusions. This limited warranty is subject to the following limitations:\n",
        "\n",
        "(i) any implied warranties, guarantees or conditions not able to be disclaimed as a matter of law will last one year from the start of the limited warranty;\n",
        "\n",
        "(ii) this limited warranty does not cover problems caused by accident, abuse or use of the Products in a manner inconsistent with this agreement or our published documentation or guidance, or resulting from events beyond our reasonable control;\n",
        "\n",
        "(iii) this limited warranty does not apply to problems caused by a failure to meet minimum system requirements; and\n",
        "\n",
        "(iv) this limited warranty does not apply to Previews or Limited Offerings.\n",
        "\n",
        "c. DISCLAIMER. Other than this warranty, we provide no warranties, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, including warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. These disclaimers will apply except to the extent applicable law does not permit them.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Defense of claims\n",
        "\n",
        "a. Defense.\n",
        "\n",
        "(i) We will defend you against any claims made by an unaffiliated third party that a Product infringes that third party's patent, copyright or trademark or makes unlawful use of its trade secret.\n",
        "\n",
        "(ii) You will defend us against any claims made by an unaffiliated third party that (1) any Customer Data, Customer Solution, or Non-Microsoft Products, or services you provide, directly or indirectly, in using a Product infringes the third party's patent, copyright, or trademark or makes unlawful use of its trade secret; or (2) arises from violation of the Acceptable Use Policy.\n",
        "\n",
        "b. Limitations. Our obligations in Section 5.a. will not apply to a claim or award based on: (i) any Customer Solution, Customer Data, Non-Microsoft Products, modifications you make to the Product, or services or materials you provide or make available as part of using the Product; (ii) your combination of the Product with, or damages based upon the value of, Customer Data or a Non-Microsoft Product, data, or business process; (iii) your use of a Microsoft trademark without our express written consent, or your use of the Product after we notify you to stop due to a third-party claim; (iv) your redistribution of the Product to, or use for the benefit of, any unaffiliated third party; or (v) Products provided free of charge.\n",
        "\n",
        "c. Remedies. If we reasonably believe that a claim under Section 5.a.(i). may bar your use of the Product, we will seek to: (i) obtain the right for you to keep using it; or (ii) modify or replace it with a functional equivalent and notify you to stop use of the prior version of the Product. If these options are not commercially reasonable, we may terminate your rights to use the Product and then refund any advance payments for unused Subscription rights.\n",
        "\n",
        "d. Obligations. Each party must notify the other promptly of a claim under this Section. The party seeking protection must (i) give the other sole control over the defense and settlement of the claim; and (ii) give reasonable help in defending the claim. The party providing the protection will (1) reimburse the other for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that it incurs in giving that help and (2) pay the amount of any resulting adverse final judgment or settlement. The parties' respective rights to defense and payment of judgments (or settlement the other consents to) under this Section 5 are in lieu of any common law or statutory indemnification rights or analogous rights, and each party waives such common law or statutory rights.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Limitation of liability\n",
        "\n",
        "a. Limitation. The aggregate liability of each party for all claims under this agreement is limited to direct damages up to the amount paid under this agreement for the Online Service during the 12 months before the cause of action arose; provided, that in no event will a party's aggregate liability for any Online Service exceed the amount paid for that Online Service during the Subscription. For Products provided free of charge, Microsoft's liability is limited to direct damages up to $5,000.00 USD.\n",
        "\n",
        "b. EXCLUSION. Neither party will be liable for loss of revenue or indirect, special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages, or damages for lost profits, revenues, business interruption, or loss of business information, even if the party knew they were possible or reasonably foreseeable.\n",
        "\n",
        "c. Exceptions to limitations. The limits of liability in this Section apply to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, but do not apply to: (1) the parties' obligations under Section 5; or (2) violation of the other's intellectual property rights.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Miscellaneous\n",
        "\n",
        "a. Notices. Notices must be in writing and will be treated as delivered on the date received at the address, date shown on the return receipt, email transmission date, or date on the courier or fax confirmation of delivery. Notices to Microsoft must be sent to the following address:\n",

Please read the Microsoft Privacy Statement (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839) (the “Privacy Statement”) as it describes the types of data we collect from you and your devices (“Data”), how we use your Data and the legal bases we have to process your Data. The Privacy Statement also describes how Microsoft uses your content, which is: your communications with others; postings submitted by you to Microsoft via the Services; and the files, photos, documents, audio, digital works, livestreams and videos that you upload, store, broadcast, create, generate or share through the Services, or inputs that you submit in order to generate content “Your Content”). Where processing is based on consent and to the extent permitted by law, by agreeing to these Terms, you consent to Microsoft’s collection, use and disclosure of Your Content and Data as described in the Privacy Statement. In some cases, we will provide separate notice and request your consent as referenced in the Privacy Statement.\n",
        "Your Content\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Your Content. Many of our Services allow you to create, store or share Your Content or receive material from others. We don’t claim ownership of Your Content. Your Content remains yours, and you are responsible for it.\n",
        "a. When you share Your Content with other people, you understand that they may be able to, on a worldwide basis, use, save, record, reproduce, broadcast, transmit, share and display Your Content for the purpose that you made Your content available on the Services, without compensating you. If you do not want others to have that ability, do not use the Services to share Your Content. You represent and warrant that for the duration of these Terms, you have (and will have) all the rights necessary for Your Content that is uploaded, stored or shared on or through the Services and that the collection, use and retention of Your Content will not violate any law or rights of others. Microsoft does not own, control, verify, pay for, endorse or otherwise assume any liability for Your Content and cannot be held responsible for Your Content or the material others upload, store or share using the Services.\n",
        "b. To the extent necessary to provide you and others with the Services, to protect you and the Services, and to improve Microsoft products and services, you grant to Microsoft a worldwide and royalty-free intellectual property licence to use Your Content, for example, to make copies of, retain, transmit, reformat, display and distribute via communication tools Your Content on the Services. If you publish Your Content in areas of the Service where it is available broadly online without restrictions, Your Content may appear in demonstrations or materials that promote the Service. Some of the Services are supported by advertising. Controls for how Microsoft personalises advertising are available at https://choice.live.com.

        "ii. Don’t engage in any activity that exploits, harms or threatens to harm children.\n",
        "iii. Don’t send spam or engage in phishing, or try to generate or distribute malware. Spam is unwanted or unsolicited bulk email, postings, contact requests, SMS (text messages), instant messages or similar electronic communications. Phishing is sending emails or other electronic communications to fraudulently or unlawfully induce recipients to reveal personal or sensitive information, such as passwords, dates of birth, National Insurance numbers, passport numbers, credit card information, financial information or other sensitive information, or to gain access to accounts or records, exfiltration of documents or other sensitive information, payment and/or financial benefit. Malware includes any activity designed to cause technical harm, such as delivering malicious executables, organising denial of service attacks or managing command and control servers.\n",
        "iv. Don’t publicly display or use the Services to generate or share inappropriate content or material (involving, for example, nudity, bestiality, pornography, offensive language, graphic violence, self-harm or criminal activity) or Your Content or material that does not comply with local laws or regulations.\n",
        "v. Don’t engage in activity that is fraudulent, false or misleading (e.g. asking for money under false pretences, impersonating someone else, creating fake accounts, automating inauthentic activity, generating or sharing content that is intentionally deceptive, manipulating the Services to increase play count or affect rankings, ratings or comments), or libellous or defamatory.\n",
        "vi. Don’t circumvent any restrictions on access to, usage or availability of the Services (e.g. attempting to “jailbreak” an AI system, or impermissible scraping).\n",
        "vii. Don’t engage in activity that is harmful to you, the Services or others (e.g. transmitting viruses, stalking, trying to generate or sharing content that harasses, bullies or threatens others, posting terrorist or violent extremist content, communicating hate speech or advocating violence against others).\n",
        "viii. Don’t violate or infringe upon the rights of others (e.g. unauthorised sharing of copyrighted music or other copyrighted material, resale or other distribution of Bing maps, or taking photographs or video/audio recordings of others without their consent for processing of an individual’s biometric identifiers/information or any other purpose using any of the Services).\n",

        "Using the Services and Support\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Using the Services and Support.\n",
        "a. Microsoft account. You’ll need a Microsoft account to access many of the Services. Your Microsoft account lets you sign in to products, websites and services provided by Microsoft and some Microsoft partners.\n",
        "i. Creating an Account. You can create a Microsoft account by signing up online. You agree not to use any false, inaccurate or misleading information when signing up for your Microsoft account. In some cases, a third party, such as your Internet service provider, may have assigned a Microsoft account to you. If you received your Microsoft account from a third party, the third party may have additional rights over your account, such as the ability to access or delete your Microsoft account. Please review any additional terms that the third party provided you with, as Microsoft has no responsibility regarding these additional terms. If you create a Microsoft account on behalf of an entity, such as your business or employer, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind that entity to these Terms. You cannot transfer your Microsoft account credentials to another user or entity. To protect your account, keep your account details and password confidential. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Microsoft account.\n",
        "ii. Account Use. You must use your Microsoft account to keep it active. This means you must sign in at least once in a two-year period to keep your Microsoft account, and associated Services, active, unless a longer period is provided in the Microsoft account activity policy at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2086738 or in an offer for a paid portion of the Services. If you don’t sign in during this time, we will assume your Microsoft account is inactive and will close it for you. Please see section 4.a.iv.2 for the consequences of a closed Microsoft account. You must sign in to your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive (separately) at least once in a one-year period, otherwise we will close your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive for you. If we reasonably suspect that your Microsoft account is at risk of being used by a third party fraudulently (for example, as a result of an account compromise), Microsoft may suspend your account until you can reclaim ownership. Based on the nature of the compromise, we may be required to disable access to some or all of Your Content. If you are having trouble accessing your Microsoft account, please visit this website: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=238656.\n",
        "iii. Children and Accounts. By creating a Microsoft account or using the Services, you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms and represent that you have either reached the age of “majority” or “legal responsibility” where you live or your parent or legal guardian agrees to be bound by these Terms on your behalf. If you do not know whether you have reached the age of “majority” or “legal responsibility” where you live, or do not understand this section, please ask your parent or legal guardian for help. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a minor, you and the minor accept and agree to be bound by these Terms and are responsible for all use of the Microsoft account or Services, including purchases, whether the minor’s account is now open or created later.\n",
        "iv. Closing Your Account.\n",
        "1. You can cancel specific Services or close your Microsoft account at any time and for any reason. To close your Microsoft account, please visit https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618278. When you ask us to close your Microsoft account, you can choose to put it in a suspended state for either 30 or 60 days just in case you change your mind. After that 30- or 60-day period, your Microsoft account will be closed. Please see section 4.a.iv.2 below for an explanation as to what happens when your Microsoft account is closed. Logging back in during the suspension period will reactivate your Microsoft account.\n",
        "2. If your Microsoft account is closed (whether by you or us), a few things happen. First, your right to use the Microsoft account to access the Services stops immediately. Second, we’ll delete Data or Your Content associated with your Microsoft account or will otherwise disassociate it from you and your Microsoft account (unless we are required by law to keep it, return it or transfer it to you or a third party identified by you). You should have a regular backup plan as Microsoft won’t be able to retrieve Your Content or Data once your account is closed. Third, you may lose access to products you’ve acquired.\n",
        "b. Moderation and Enforcement. Many of our Services that allow you to interact, create, generate and share content with others leverage safety systems to protect our Services and other users.\n",
        "i. Policies. Our Code of Conduct identifies what’s prohibited when using our Services. Our content and conduct policies can be found here (https://www.microsoft.com/DigitalSafety/policies). Specific Services have additional policies and community standards applicable to their users, which are available here (https://aka.ms/trustandsafety).\n",
        "ii. Reporting a Concern. You can report concerning content or conduct that may violate our Code of Conduct here (https://aka.ms/reportconcerns).\n",
        "iii. Review. Where applicable, we may use automated systems and humans to review content to identify suspected spam, viruses, fraud, phishing, malware, jailbreaking or other illegal or harmful content or conduct.\n",
        "iv. Enforcement. We reserve the right to deny content if it exceeds limits on storage or file size allowed by the Service. We may block, remove or decline to display content if it appears to violate our Code of Conduct or another Service policy or where required by law. If you violate these terms or Policies (https://aka.ms/trustandsafety), we may take action against your account. This could include limiting access to certain features or Services, stopping providing Services, closing your Microsoft account immediately or blocking delivery of a communication (such as email, file sharing or instant message) to or from the Services. Closure of your access to a Service or your account may result in forfeiture of content licences, associated content, memberships and Microsoft account balances associated with the account. When reviewing alleged violations of these Terms, Microsoft reserves the right to review content to resolve the issue. However, we cannot monitor the entirety of the Services and make no attempt to do so. For more information about the moderation and enforcement processes (https://www.microsoft.com/DigitalSafety/moderation-and-enforcement), Service specific terms, Additional policies and guidelines (https://www.microsoft.com/DigitalSafety/policies/additional-guidelines) and appeals (https://www.microsoft.com/DigitalSafety/moderation-and-enforcement/appeals), see https://aka.ms/trustandsafety. Information about our policy relating to claims of intellectual property infringement may be found at NOTICES.\n",
        "c. Work or School Accounts. You can sign in to certain Microsoft services with a work or school email address. If you do, you agree that the owner of the domain associated with your email address may be notified of the existence of your Microsoft account and its associated subscriptions, control and administer your account, and access and process your Data, including the contents of your communications and files, and that Microsoft may notify the owner of the domain if the account or Data is compromised. You further agree that your use of the Microsoft services may be subject to the agreements Microsoft has with you or your organisation and these Terms may not apply. If you already have a Microsoft account and you use a separate work or school email address to access Services covered under these Terms, you may be prompted to update the email address associated with your Microsoft account in order to continue accessing such Services.\n",
        "d. Additional Equipment/Data Plans. To use many of the Services, you’ll need an Internet connection and/or data/mobile plan. You might also need additional equipment, such as a headset, camera or microphone. You are responsible for providing all connections, plans and equipment needed to use the Services and for paying the fees charged by the provider(s) of your connections, plans and equipment. Those fees are in addition to any fees you pay us for the Services, and we will not reimburse you for such fees. Check with your provider(s) to determine if there are any such fees that may apply to you.\n",
        "e. Service Notifications. When there’s something we need to tell you about a Service you use, we’ll send you Service notifications. If you gave us your email address or phone number in connection with your Microsoft account, then we may send Service notifications to you via email or via SMS (text message), including to verify your identity before registering your mobile phone number and verifying your purchases. We may also send you Service notifications by other means (for example, by in-product messages). Data or messaging rates may apply when receiving notifications via SMS.\n",
        "f. Support. Customer support for some Services is available at https://support.microsoft.com. Certain Services may offer separate or additional customer support, subject to the terms available at https://microsoft.com/support-service-agreement, unless otherwise specified. Support may not be available for preview or beta versions of features or Services. The Services might not be compatible with software or services provided by third parties, and you are responsible for familiarising yourself with compatibility requirements.\n",
        "i. For consumers living in Australia: If you are using a good or service that is subject to the Telecommunications Consumer Protection Code, you are entitled to use an Advocate to communicate with Microsoft; a person acting as your Advocate has no power to act on your behalf or access your information without your presence and agreement to such action. You are also entitled to appoint an Authorised Representative that has the power to access your information and act on your behalf as your agent.\n",
        "g. Ending your Services. If your Services are cancelled (whether by you or us), first your right to access the Services stops immediately and your licence to the software related to the Services ends. Second, we’ll delete Data or Your Content associated with your Service or will otherwise disassociate it from you and your Microsoft account (unless we are required by law to keep it, return it or transfer it to you or a third party identified by you). As a result, you may no longer be able to access any of the Services (or Your Content that you’ve stored on those Services). You should have a regular backup plan. Third, you may lose access to products you’ve acquired. If you have cancelled your Microsoft account and have no other account able to access the Services, your Services may be cancelled immediately.\n",
        "Using Third-Party Apps and Services\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Using Third-Party Apps and Services. The Services may allow you to access or acquire products, services, websites, links, content, material, games, skills, integrations, bots or applications from independent third parties (companies or people who aren’t Microsoft) (\"Third-Party Apps and Services\"). Many of our Services also help you find, make requests to or interact with Third-Party Apps and Services and may allow or require you to share Your Content or Data with such Third-Party Apps and Services, and you understand that by using our Services you are directing them to make Third-Party Apps and Services available to you. The Third-Party Apps and Services may allow or require you to store Your Content or Data with the publisher, provider or operator of the Third-Party Apps and Services. The Third-Party Apps and Services may present you with a privacy policy or require you to accept their terms before you can install or use the Third-Party App or Service. See section 13.b for additional terms for applications acquired through certain Stores owned or operated by Microsoft or its affiliates (including, but not limited to, the Office Store, the Microsoft Store on Xbox and the Microsoft Store on Windows). You should review the third-party terms and privacy policies before acquiring, using, requesting or linking your Microsoft Account to any Third-Party Apps and Services. Any third-party terms do not modify these Terms. Microsoft does not license any intellectual property to you as part of any Third-Party Apps and Services. You agree to assume all risk and liability arising from your use of these Third-Party Apps and Services and that Microsoft is not responsible for any issues arising out of your use of them. Microsoft is not responsible or liable to you or others for information or services provided by any Third-Party Apps and Services.\n",

        "\n",
        "6. Service Availability.\n",
        "a. The Services, Third-Party Apps and Services, or material or products offered through the Services may be unavailable from time to time, may be offered on a limited basis or may vary depending on your region or device. If you change the location associated with your Microsoft account, you may need to re-acquire material or applications that were available to you and paid for in your previous region. You agree not to access or use material or Services which are illegal or not licensed for use in the country from which you access or use such material or Services, or to conceal or misrepresent your location or identity in order to access or use such material or Services.\n",
        "b. We strive to keep the Services up and running; however, all online services suffer occasional disruptions and outages and Microsoft is not liable for any disruption or loss you may suffer as a result. In the event of an outage, you may not be able to retrieve Your Content or Data that you’ve stored. We recommend that you regularly backup Your Content and Data that you store on the Services or store using Third-Party Apps and Services.\n",
        "Updates to the Services or Software and Changes to These Terms\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Updates to the Services or Software and Changes to These Terms.\n",
        "a. We may change these Terms at any time, and we’ll tell you when we do. Using the Services after the changes become effective means you agree to the new terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you must stop using the Services, close your Microsoft account and, if you are a parent or guardian, help your minor child close his or her Microsoft account.\n",
        "b. Sometimes you will need software updates to keep using the Services. We may automatically check your version of the software and download software updates or configuration changes. You may also be required to update the software to continue using the Services. Such updates are subject to these Terms unless other terms accompany the updates, in which case, those other terms apply. Microsoft isn't obligated to make any updates available and doesn't guarantee that we will support the version of the system for which you purchased or licensed the software, apps, content or other products. Such updates may not be compatible with software or services provided by third parties. You may withdraw your consent to future software updates at any time by uninstalling the software.\n",
        "c. Additionally, there may be times when we need to remove or change features or functionality of the Service or stop providing a Service or access to Third-Party Apps and Services altogether. Except to the extent required by applicable law, we have no obligation to provide a re-download or replacement of any material, Digital Goods (defined in section 13.i), or applications previously purchased. We may release the Services or their features in a preview or beta version, which may not work correctly or in the same way the final version may work.\n",
        "d. So that you can use material protected with digital rights management (DRM), like some music, games, films, books and more, DRM software may automatically contact an online rights server and download and install DRM updates.\n",
        "Software Licence\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Software Licence. Unless accompanied by a separate Microsoft licence agreement (for example, if you are using a Microsoft application that is included with and a part of Windows, then the Microsoft Software Licence Terms for the Windows Operating System govern such software), any software provided by us to you as part of the Services is subject to these Terms. Applications acquired through certain Stores owned or operated by Microsoft or its affiliates (including, but not limited to the Office Store, Microsoft Store on Windows and Microsoft Store on Xbox) are subject to section 13.b.i below.\n",
        "a. If you comply with these Terms, we grant you the right to install and use one copy of the software per device on a worldwide basis for use by only one person at a time as part of your use of the Services. For certain devices, such software may be pre-installed for your personal, non-commercial use of the Services. The software or website that is part of the Services may include third-party code. Any third-party scripts or code, linked to or referenced from the software or website, are licensed to you by the third parties that own such code, not by Microsoft. Notices, if any, for the third-party code are included for your information only.\n",
        "b. The software is licensed, not sold, and Microsoft reserves all rights to the software not expressly granted by Microsoft, whether by implication, estoppel or otherwise. This licence does not give you any right to, and you may not:\n",
        "i. circumvent or bypass any technological protection measures in or relating to the software or Services;\n",
        "ii. disassemble, decompile, decrypt, hack, emulate, exploit or reverse engineer any software or other aspect of the Services that is included in or accessible through the Services, except and only to the extent that the applicable copyright law expressly permits doing so;\n",

        "iv. publish, copy, rent, lease, sell, export, import, distribute or lend the software or the Services, unless Microsoft expressly authorises you to do so;\n",
        "v. transfer the software, any software licences, or any rights to access or use the Services;\n",

        "a. Charges. If there is a charge associated with a portion of the Services, you agree to pay that charge in the currency specified. The price stated for the Services excludes all applicable taxes and currency exchange settlements, unless stated otherwise. All prices for Skype paid products are inclusive of applicable taxes, unless otherwise stated. You are solely responsible for paying such taxes or other charges. Skype calculates taxes based on the residential address associated with your billing information. You are responsible for ensuring that this address is up to date and accurate. Except for Skype products, taxes are calculated based on your location at the time your Microsoft account was registered unless local law requires a different basis for the calculation. We may suspend or cancel the Services if we do not receive an on time, full payment from you. Suspension or cancellation of the Services for non-payment could result in a loss of access to and use of your account and its content. Connecting to the Internet via a corporate or other private network that masks your location may cause charges to be different from those displayed for your actual location. Depending on your location, some transactions might require foreign currency conversion or be processed in another country. Your bank might charge you additional fees for those services when you use a debit or credit card. Please contact your bank for details.\n",
        "b. Your Billing Account. To pay the charges for a Service, you will be asked to provide a payment method at the time you sign up for that Service. For all Services other than Skype, you can access and change your billing information and payment method on the Microsoft account management website (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618281) and for Skype software and products by signing into your account portal at https://skype.com/go/myaccount. Additionally, you agree to permit Microsoft to use any updated account information regarding your selected payment method provided by your issuing bank or the applicable payment network. You agree to promptly update your account and other information, including your email address and payment method details, so we can complete your transactions and contact you as needed in connection with your transactions. Changes made to your billing account will not affect charges we submit to your billing account before we could reasonably act on your changes to your billing account.\n",
        "c. Billing. By providing Microsoft with a payment method, you (i) represent that you are authorised to use the payment method you provided and that any payment information you provide is true and accurate; (ii) authorise Microsoft to charge you for the Services or available content using your payment method; and (iii) authorise Microsoft to charge you for any paid feature of the Services you choose to sign up for or use while these Terms are in force. We may bill you (a) in advance; (b) at the time of purchase; (c) shortly after purchase or (d) on a recurring basis for subscription Services. Also, we may charge you up to the amount you have approved, and we will notify you in advance of any change in the amount to be charged for recurring subscription Services. We may bill you at the same time for more than one of your prior billing periods for amounts that haven't previously been processed.\n",
        "d. Recurring Payments. When you purchase the Services on a subscription basis (e.g., monthly, every 3 months or annually), you agree that you are authorising recurring payments, and payments will be made to Microsoft by the method and at the recurring intervals you have agreed to, until the subscription for that Service is terminated by you or by Microsoft. You must cancel your Services before the next billing date to stop being charged to continue your Services. We will provide you with instructions on how you may cancel the Services. By authorising recurring payments, you are authorising Microsoft to process such payments as either electronic debits or fund transfers, or as electronic drafts from your designated account (for Automated Clearing House or similar payments), or as charges to your designated account (for credit card or similar payments) (collectively, \"Electronic Payments\"). Subscription fees are generally charged in advance of the applicable subscription period. If any payment is returned unpaid or if any credit card or similar transaction is rejected or denied, Microsoft or its service providers reserve the right to collect any applicable return item, rejection or insufficient funds fee and process any such payment as an Electronic Payment.\n",
        "e. Online Statement and Errors. For all Services other than Skype, Microsoft will provide you with an online billing statement on the Microsoft account management website (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618282), where you can view and print your statement. For Skype, you can access your online statement by signing into your account at www.skype.com (https://www.skype.com). This is the only billing statement that we provide. If we make an error on your bill, you must tell us within 90-days after the error first appears on your bill. We will then promptly investigate the charge. If you do not tell us within that time, you release us from all liability and claims of loss resulting from the error and we won't be required to correct the error or provide a refund, unless otherwise required by law. If Microsoft has identified a billing error, we will correct that error within 90 days. This policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\n",
        "f. Refund Policy. Unless otherwise provided by law or the terms of a particular Service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable. If you believe that Microsoft has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge. No refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old, unless otherwise required by law. We reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion unless otherwise required by law. If we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future. This refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply. For more refund information, please visit our help topic (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618283). If you live in Taiwan or Israel, please note that according to the Consumer Protection Act and its relevant regulations, all purchases pertaining to digital content provided via intangible form and/or on-line services are final and non-refundable when such content or service has been provided on line. You are not entitled to claim any cooling off period or any refund.\n",
        "g. Cancelling the Services. You may cancel a Service at any time, with or without cause. Cancelling paid Services stops future charges to continue the Service. To cancel a Service and request a refund, if you are entitled to one, visit the Microsoft account management website. For Skype, please complete the Withdrawal Form using the information provided here (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618286). You should refer back to the offer describing the Services as (i) you may not receive a refund at the time of cancellation; (ii) you may be obliged to pay cancellation charges; (iii) you may be obliged to pay all charges made to your billing account for the Services before the date of cancellation; and (iv) you may lose access to and use of your account when you cancel the Services; or, if you live in Taiwan or Israel, (v) you may receive a refund in the amount equal to the unused fees you paid for a Service calculated at the time of cancellation. If you live in Israel you may cancel by any of the means listed on https://support.microsoft.com/help/4027815. Please contact a Microsoft representative by telephone to obtain a refund if you are eligible for it. We will process your Data as described above in section 4. If you cancel, your access to the Services ends at the end of your current Service period or, if we bill your account on a periodic basis, at the end of the period in which you cancelled. If you initiate a chargeback or reversal with your bank for your payment of Services, we will deem you to have cancelled as of the date that the original payment was made, and you authorise us to immediately cancel your service and/or revoke any content that was provided to you in exchange for such payment.\n",
        "h. Trial-Period Offers. If you are taking part in any trial-period offer, you may be required to cancel the trial Service(s) within the timeframe communicated to you when you accepted the offer in order to avoid being charged to continue the Service(s) at the end of the trial period.\n",
        "i. Promotional Offers. From time to time, Microsoft may offer Services for free for a trial period. Microsoft reserves the right to charge you for such Services (at the normal rate) if Microsoft determines (in its reasonable discretion) that you are abusing the terms of the offer.\n",
        "j. Price Changes. We may change the price of the Services at any time and if you have a recurring purchase, we will notify you by email, or other reasonable manner, at least 15 days before the price change. If you do not agree to the price change, you must cancel and stop using the Services before the price change takes effect. If there is a fixed term and price for your Service offer, that price will remain in force for the fixed term.\n",
        "k. Payments to You. If we owe you a payment, then you agree to timely and accurately provide us with any information we need to get that payment to you. Subject to applicable law, you are responsible for any taxes and charges you may incur as a result of this payment to you. You must also comply with any other conditions we place on your right to any payment. If you receive a payment in error, we may reverse or require return of the payment. You agree to cooperate with us in our efforts to do this. We may also reduce the payment to you without notice to adjust it for any previous over-payment.\n",
        "l. Gift Cards. Redemption and use of gift cards (other than Skype gift cards) are governed by the Microsoft Gift Card Terms and Conditions (https://support.microsoft.com/help/10562/microsoft-account-gift-card-terms-and-conditions). Information on Skype gift cards is available on Skype’s Help page (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=615383).\n",
        "m. Bank Account Payment Method. You may register an eligible bank account with your Microsoft account to use it as a payment method. Eligible bank accounts include accounts held at a financial institution capable of receiving direct debit entries (e.g. a United States-based financial institution that supports automated clearing house (\"ACH\") entries, a European financial institution that supports Single Euro Payments Area (\"SEPA\") or \"iDEAL\" in the Netherlands). Terms you agreed to when adding your bank account as a payment method in your Microsoft account (e.g., the \"mandate\" in the case of SEPA) also apply. You represent and warrant that your registered bank account is held in your name or you are authorised to register and use this bank account as a payment method. By registering or selecting your bank account as your payment method, you authorise Microsoft (or its agent) to initiate one or more debits for the total amount of your purchase or subscription charge (in accordance with the terms of your subscription service) from your bank account (and, if necessary, initiate one or more credits to your bank account to correct errors, issue a refund or similar purpose), and you authorise the financial institution that holds your bank account to deduct such debits or accept such credits. You understand that this authorisation will remain in full force and effect until you remove your bank account information from your Microsoft account. Contact customer support as outlined above in section 4.e as soon as possible if you believe you have been charged in error. Laws applicable in your country may also limit your liability for any fraudulent, erroneous or unauthorised transactions from your bank account. By registering or selecting a bank account as your payment method, you acknowledge that you have read, understand and agree to these Terms.\n",

Using applications can distract you and obstruct your surroundings. Avoid trip hazards, stairs, low ceilings, fragile or valuable items that could be damaged. A very small percentage of people may experience seizures when exposed to certain visual images like flashing lights or patterns that may appear in applications. Even people with no history of seizures may have an undiagnosed condition that can cause these seizures. Symptoms may include lightheadedness, altered vision, twitching, jerking or shaking of limbs, disorientation, confusion, loss of consciousness or convulsions. Immediately stop using and consult a doctor if you experience any of these symptoms, or consult a doctor before using the applications if you’ve ever suffered symptoms linked to seizures.

Call charges will be deducted from your Skype Credit balance. Microsoft may change its calling rates at any time by posting such change at www.skype.com/go/allrates. The new rate will apply to your next call after publication of the new rates. Please check the latest rates before you make your call. Fractional call minutes and fractional charges will be rounded up to the next whole unit.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may be entitled, under applicable law, to a refund, upon request, of any pre-paid subscription balance in the event you switch your Skype Number to another provider.\n",
        "ix. Skype Credit. Microsoft does not guarantee that you will be able to use your Skype Credit balance to purchase all Skype paid products. If you do not use your Skype Credit for a period of 180-days, Microsoft will place your Skype Credit on inactive status. You can reactivate the Skype Credit by following the reactivation link at https://www.skype.com/go/store.reactivate.credit. If you are located in Japan and you buy Skype Credit from the Skype website, the preceding two sentences do not apply to you and your Skype Credit shall expire 180 days after the date of purchase. Once your credit expires, you will no longer be able to reactivate it or use it. You can enable the Auto Recharge feature when you buy Skype Credit by ticking the appropriate box. If enabled, your Skype Credit balance will be recharged with the same amount and your chosen payment method every time your Skype balance goes below the threshold set by Skype from time to time. If you purchased a subscription with a payment method other than credit card, PayPal or Moneybookers (Skrill), and you have enabled Auto-Recharge, your Skype Credit balance will be recharged with the amount necessary to purchase your next recurring subscription. You can disable Auto-Recharge at any time by accessing and changing your settings in your account portal in Skype.\n",

Use of a virtual private network (VPN) or other technology or service that can be used to mask or obfuscate your geographic location may result in cancellation of your Rewards Account and forfeiture of your accrued Points.\n",

Eligible Offers may vary by Region and may only be available for a certain time or subject to other limitations. You must comply with all terms and conditions of a particular Offer to earn Points awarded with that Offer. You may be presented with Offers directly on the Rewards Dashboard or when you use certain Microsoft products and services.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Microsoft may from time to time at its sole discretion permit you (i) to share your Points within your household (limits may apply), (ii) to contribute your Points to support a non-profit organisation listed on the Redemption Page, or (iii) depending on your Region and subject to other terms and conditions, to redeem all or some of your Points for points in certain other rewards or loyalty programmes, including programmes operated by Microsoft or authorised third parties. Points are and remain at all times the property of Microsoft, and do not constitute your personal property; they have no cash value, and you may not obtain any cash or money in exchange for them. Points are awarded to you on a promotional basis only. You cannot purchase Points. Microsoft may limit the quantity of Points or Rewards that can be earned or redeemed per person, per household or over a set period (e.g. a day) provided that you are not disadvantaged in breach of good faith; please refer to the FAQ for currently applicable limitations. Unless an Offer or Redemption Option explicitly states otherwise, Points earned in the Programme are not valid in, and may not be used in combination with, any other programme offered by Microsoft or third parties. Unredeemed Points associated with your Rewards Account expire if you do not earn or redeem any Points in your Rewards Account for 18 consecutive months.\n",

Once you redeem your Points, you cannot cancel or return the Redemption Option for a refund of Points except in the case of defective products or as required by applicable law. If you select a Redemption Option that is out of stock or unavailable for other reasons, we may substitute a Redemption Option of comparable value or refund your points at our sole discretion.\n",

Rewards will be emailed to the email address associated with your Microsoft account, so keep your email address up to date. Rewards that are undeliverable will not be reissued and are therefore forfeited. Rewards may not be resold. You may redeem no more than 550,000 Points per calendar year in the Rewards Programme.\n",
        "x. Cancelling Your Rewards Account. If you no longer wish to participate in the Rewards Programme, follow the instructions on the opt out page (https://account.microsoft.com/rewards/optout?confirm=false) to cancel your Rewards Account. If you cancel your Rewards Account, you will immediately forfeit all of your earned Points and will lose your ability to earn new Points in the future.

Your Rewards Account may be cancelled (and your Points forfeited) if you do not log in to your Microsoft account for 18 consecutive months.\n",
        "xi. Programme Changes or Discontinuation. Microsoft reserves the right to change, modify, discontinue or cancel the Rewards Programme or any part thereof at any time, at its sole discretion and without prior notice. However, if the Rewards Programme is cancelled or discontinued, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you by email and on the Rewards Dashboard and to provide you with at least 90 days to redeem your accrued Points, unless we determine that such cancellation must take effect immediately for legal or security reasons.\n",
        "xii. Other Terms. Microsoft reserves the right to immediately cancel your Rewards Account, disqualify you from future participation in the Rewards Programme, forfeit all of your earned Points and cancel or suspend any Redemption Option you have obtained through the Rewards Programme if Microsoft believes you have tampered with, abused or defrauded any aspect of the Rewards Programme or breached these terms. Microsoft further reserves the right to cancel or suspend any Redemption Option you have obtained or attempted to obtain through the Rewards Programme if Microsoft determines you are ineligible to receive that Redemption Option for legal reasons (such as export laws). While Microsoft makes every effort to ensure accuracy, errors occasionally occur. Microsoft therefore reserves the right to correct such errors at any time, even if it affects current Offers or your pending, earned or redeemed Points or Rewards.
